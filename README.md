# ‚ù§Ô∏è Heart Disease Prediction

This project builds a machine learning model to predict the presence of heart disease based on patient clinical data. The goal is to help in early detection and assist medical decision making by classifying high vs. low risk cases.

## üß∞ Tech Stack & Tools

- Python  
- Jupyter Notebook  
- Pandas  
- NumPy  
- Scikit-learn

## üìà Problem Statement & Approach

**Problem:** Given patient features (age, blood pressure, cholesterol, etc.), predict whether a person is likely to have heart disease (binary classification).

**Approach:**
1. Load and explore the dataset  
2. Clean / preprocess data (handle missing values, encoding, scaling)  
3. Split into train and test sets  
4. Train machine learning models (e.g. Logistic Regression, Random Forest, etc.)  
5. Evaluate performance (accuracy, precision, recall, AUC, confusion matrix)  
6. Interpret model and analyze feature importance  
7. (Optional) Deploy the model for inference or UI
